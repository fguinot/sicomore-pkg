Description: From a set of input matrices and phenotype related to the
    same set of individual, sicomore <arxiv:1810.12169> is a two-step method which 
    1) finds and select groups of correlated variables in each input matrix
    which are good predictors for the common phenotype; and 2) finds the most
    predictive interaction effects between the set of data by testing for
    interaction between the selected groups of each input matrix.
