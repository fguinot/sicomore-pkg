# SIComORe

Selection of Interaction effects in COmpressed Multiple Omics REpresentation

## Description 

From a set of input matrices and phenotype related to the same set of individual, sicomore is a two-step method which 1) find and select groups of correlated variables in each input matrix which are good predictors for the common phenotype; 2. find the most predictive interaction effects between the set of data by testing for interaction between the selected groups of each input matrix
